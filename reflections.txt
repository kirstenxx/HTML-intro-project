You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
- New skills: focusing more on creating cleaner & easier to edit code. Prior history with HTML, so a bit of a learning curve trying to make things work up to what I'm assuming is now industry standard.
- Easy: Using resources if I get stuck on something
- Difficult: once I've created a problem, figuring out how to undo the problem
- Problem solving: I've stepped away a few times during this module to stop looking at the same thing and refresh my mind.
